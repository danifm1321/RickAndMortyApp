# RickAndMortyApp
Rick and Morty app


For this exercise, you can use this API Client por Swift: https://github.com/benjaminbruch/Rick-and-Morty-Swift-API
However, I chose not to use it to demostrate my knowledge about REST.

For this app, I wanted to propose 2 different approaches. The first one is a list with all the characters available. The second one, is a paginated list that only shows 20 characters per page.
